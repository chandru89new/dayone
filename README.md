I built this app for two things:

- to learn some parts of React Router and Redux
- to have a personal, simpler todo list

### Features:

- everything is stored in localstorage
- tasks / todos are part of projects. you can have many projects
- you can export tasks and projects (ie all data). the 'Export' link copies everything to your clipboard for now
- currently, no way to add a project from a good UI. you can still go to `/raw`, select "projects" from the dropdown and add a project (or remove)
- you can prioritize upto three tasks per project at any given time.

Project is deployed at [https://dayone-933b2.firebaseapp.com/](https://dayone-933b2.firebaseapp.com). Since it simply uses localstorage for now, you can use it right away. Check the code if you fear tracking (there is none in the app).
